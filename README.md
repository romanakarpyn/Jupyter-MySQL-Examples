# SQL-queries
<p> In this project, I connect Jupyter Notebook to MySQL, a relational database management system, and run different queries to extract the required information.</p>
<p>To run the queries, you need to install MySQL Workbench and load the Sakila database.</p>
<p>The Notebook requires importing the following libraries:</p> 
  
- import pandas as pd
- from getpass import getpass
- from mysql.connector import connect
